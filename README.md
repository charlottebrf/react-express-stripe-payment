## Why are we doing this project?
ThoughtWorks' Building an Equitable Future working group research the social impact of tech trends, with a view to building a more equitable tech future. We want to continue from the success of the Building a more equitable tech future ideation day on 30th September to bring together technical and non-technical people to create tech solutions to drive positive social impact with technology.

We want to sustainably support and scale up projects that have a clear positive impact on society.

We are carrying out a three month programme that takes 2 of the 6 projects created during the Building an Equitable Tech Future Ideation day on 30th September to be mentored by ThoughtWorks to build a protoptype.


## Problem statement
Disrupt Charitable Giving: We are finding a cheaper and more efficient way to donate to unbanked or underbanked parties.
